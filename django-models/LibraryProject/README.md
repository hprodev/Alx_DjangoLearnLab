## Key Files Explained

- **settings.py**: Contains all configuration settings for the Django project including database configuration, installed apps, middleware, and other project-specific settings.

- **urls.py**: The URL dispatcher that maps URL patterns to views. Acts as a "table of contents" for your Django-powered site.

- **manage.py**: A command-line utility that provides various Django management commands such as running the development server, creating migrations, and managing the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 4.0 or higher

### Installation

1. Install Django:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd LibraryProject
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Development Server

The Django development server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default. You should see the Django welcome page when you first visit this URL, indicating that your project has been set up correctly.

## Next Steps

- Create Django applications within this project
- Configure database settings
- Define models, views, and templates
- Set up URL routing for your applications

## Project Status

This is the initial setup of the LibraryProject. The project structure has been created and the development server is ready to run.
